        <h2>Info</h2>
        <p>After bonding over a mutual love of Gregorian chants in 2011, Keena Batti & Molly Falck set out to make the
          Dark Ages cool again. They began by mostly composing dirges until realizing there’s more to music than minor
          chords. Thus, a rock band was born.

          Since then, they’ve evolved from their medieval origins and embraced the sounds of late 80s and early 90s
          pop-rock. They released their first EP, Feed, in 2018. Some guy once said it sounded like the B-52s. They
          can’t remember his name though.

          The duo’s second EP, Crying in Bathrooms, combines their chronic sense of melancholy with upbeat, jangly
          guitars and airy synths. As usual, many tears were shed during the process. </p>
